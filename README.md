# OIBSIP_TASKNO1

This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is often used for learning and benchmarking purposes.

## Problem Statement

Iris flowers are categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species differs according to their measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify iris flowers into their correct species.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is commonly available in various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers along with their corresponding species labels.

## Approach

The following steps are followed to train the machine learning model:

1. **Data Loading**: The Iris dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's `load_iris()` function.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed, which includes scaling the features using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have the same scale.

3. **Model Selection**: A logistic regression model is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. Other classification algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines can also be considered.

4. **Model Training**: The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.

6. **Model Tuning (Optional)**: Hyperparameters of the model can be tuned using techniques like cross-validation or grid search to improve performance.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be deployed for making predictions on new data.


## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 93.3% on the test dataset, indicating its ability to classify iris flowers into their correct species based on their measurements.
